## Examples
In the [examples folder](./examples) are available the Notebooks and the scripts to reproduce the analysis presented in the manuscript.

## Docker image
If you want to run some of the examples provided in the example folder you can directly install the PyGMQL docker image.

```
docker pull gecopolimi/pygmql
```

You can run the docker instance using the following command:
```
docker run --rm \
           --name pygmql_instance \
           -p <port>:8888 \
           gecopolimi/pygmql
```

where you can set `<port>` to any free port number on your machine.
This will start a Jupyter Lab server which will run at the address
```
https://localhost:<port>
``` 

Inside the docker you will find the `example` folder containing both notebooks and scripts.

## Requirements
The library requires the following:
* Python 3.4+
* The latest version of JAVA installed
* The JAVA_HOME variable set to the Java installation folder (example: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_161` or `~/jdk1.8.0_161`)


## Installation
### From github
First of all download this repository in a choosen location:
```
git clone https://github.com/DEIB-GECO/PyGMQL.git
```
Than go inside the library folder and install the package as follows:
```
cd PyGMQL
pip install -e .
```

### From PyPi
```
pip install gmql
```

## Setup

### Use Anaconda
We suggest to manage your python distribution through Anaconda. 
The latest version of can be downloaded from https://www.continuum.io/downloads.

Once your Anaconda distribution is installed, let's create a brand new environment:
```
conda create --name pygmql python=3
```
### Check if JAVA is installed 
Check that the `JAVA_HOME` enviroment variable is correctly set to 
the latest JAVA distribution.
```
echo $JAVA_HOME
```
If the variable is not set (the previous command does not show nothing), you may need
to install JAVA (https://www.java.com/it/download/) and then set `JAVA_HOME` like the following:

On linux:
```
echo export "JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

On Mac:
```
echo export "JAVA_HOME=\$(/usr/libexec/java_home)" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

On Windows:

1. Right click My Computer and select Properties.
2. On the Advanced tab, select Environment Variables, and then 
edit JAVA_HOME to point to where the JDK software is located, 
for example, C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_02.


### Use it in Jupyter Notebooks
We strongly suggest to use the library with the support of a **Jupyter Notebook**
for the best graphical rendering of the data structures.
It may be necessary to manually install the Jupyter kernel:
```
source activate pygmql
python -m ipykernel install --user --name pygmql --display-name "Python (pygmql)"
```

### Keep the code updated
This is a constantly evolving project. Therefore the library will be
constantly added with new features. Therefore we suggest to update your
local copy periodically:
```
cd PyGMQL
git pull
```
