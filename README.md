# GMQL-Python
API for calling interactively the GMQL Engine from Python

## Setup
First of all download this repository in a choosen location:
```
    git clone https://github.com/DEIB-GECO/PyGMQL.git
```
Check that the `JAVA_HOME` enviroment variable is correctly set to the latest JAVA distribution.
```
    echo $JAVA_HOME
```
Than go inside the library folder and install the package as follows:

We strongly suggest to use the library with the support of a **Jupyter Notebook**
for the best graphical rendering of the data structures.
