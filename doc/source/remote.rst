Remote data management
======================

PyGMQL can be used in two different ways. The first one (and the most intuitive and classical one)
is to use it like any other computational library.

The second way is to make the library interact with a remote server. In order to do that you need to
create an instance of a *RemoteManager*.

.. currentmodule:: gmql.RemoteConnection.RemoteManager
..  autoclass:: RemoteManager
