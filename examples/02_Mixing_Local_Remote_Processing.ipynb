    "\n",
    "The `to_matrix` method is particularly versatile since it enables the user to project region and metadata at the same time. For example, in our case the information about the histone modification name is stored as a metadata attribute `hm.experiment_target` while we want to use the `avg_signal` region field as matrix value. The `to_matrix` methods therefore enable us to aggregate the information of both regions and metadata in a single structure. \n",
